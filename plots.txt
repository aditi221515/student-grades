## Student grade plots 

To graphically interpret relationships between all numeric and qualitative variables from the student grade dataset, we used various types of data visualization tools to display these relationships.

We used histograms, density plots, boxplots, scatterplots, and bar plots to display relationships between variables and to understand trends and patterns in our data.

Presenting a graphical representation of the data and its relationships, helps stakeholders to take make important decisions about the project.
